# SAS Solver Suite - Implemented Features

This document tracks the features and functionalities that have been successfully implemented in the SAS Solver Suite.

## Core SAS Algorithm Integration (TSP)

*   [x] **TSP Solver Page:** Dedicated page (`/tsp-solver`) for interacting with the SAS algorithm for TSP.
*   [x] **Web Worker:** SAS algorithm implemented in `public/solve-worker.js` for background processing, preventing UI freeze.
    *   [x] **Refactored Web Worker:** Original `solve-worker.js` refactored into a class-based structure in `public/sas-solver.worker.js` for improved readability and organization. TSP Solver page now uses this refactored worker.
*   [x] **TSPLIB Instance Loading:**
    *   [x] Dropdown to select standard TSPLIB instances.
    *   [x] API route (`/api/tsp-instance`) to fetch TSPLIB file content from the server.
    *   [x] Client-side parsing of TSPLIB file format.
*   [x] **Custom Instance Input:** Textarea for users to paste custom TSP data in TSPLIB format.

## Visualization & User Interface

*   [x] **Canvas Visualization:**
    *   [x] Display of city coordinates from loaded TSP instances.
    *   [x] Real-time drawing of the best solution path found by SAS.
    *   [x] Auto-scaling of coordinates to fit the canvas.
*   [x] **UI Components:**
    *   [x] Use of ShadCN UI components for a consistent and modern look and feel (Cards, Buttons, Inputs, Selects, etc.).
    *   [x] Responsive layout.
*   [x] **Navigation:** Sidebar navigation for easy access to different sections of the application.
*   [x] **Dark Mode Support:** Basic dark mode styling through `globals.css`.

## Solver Controls & Real-time Feedback

*   [x] **Parameter Configuration:** Input field for `Max K` (maximum number of alternatives).
*   [x] **Solver Control:**
    *   [x] "Run SAS Solver" button to initiate a single solver run.
    *   [x] Button changes to "Stop Solver" during execution to terminate the worker.
*   [x] **Live Statistics Display:**
    *   [x] Iterations performed by the solver.
    *   [x] Number of improvements found.
    *   [x] Current `K` value being explored by the solver.
    *   [x] Best path length (distance) found so far.
*   [x] **Elapsed Time:** Timer to display the duration of solver runs (single and batch).

## Optimal Solution Comparison

*   [x] **Load Optimal Solutions:**
    *   [x] API route (`/api/optimal-solutions`) to read and parse `optimal-solutions.txt`.
    *   [x] Client-side fetching of optimal solution data.
*   [x] **Display Optimal Data:**
    *   [x] Show the known optimal path length for the selected TSPLIB instance.
*   [x] **Approximation Ratio:** Calculate and display the ratio of (SAS Best Path / Optimal Path).
*   [x] **Standardized Distance Calculation:** Worker updated to use `Math.round()` for Euclidean distances, aligning with TSPLIB integer distances.

## Batch Analysis Feature

*   [x] **Batch Configuration:** Input field for "Number of Runs" for batch analysis.
*   [x] **Batch Execution Control:** "Run Batch Analysis" button, changing to "Stop Batch" during execution.
*   [x] **Progress Indication:**
    *   [x] Display current run number (e.g., "Run X of Y").
    *   [x] Estimated Time Remaining (ETR) for the batch.
*   [x] **Individual Run Display:** During batch execution, main stats and canvas update for each individual run.
*   [x] **Aggregated Batch Statistics:**
    *   [x] Displayed in a dedicated "Batch Analysis Summary" card.
    *   [x] Instance name and `Max K` used for the batch.
    *   [x] Minimum distance found in the batch (with its approximation ratio).
    *   [x] Maximum distance found in the batch (with its approximation ratio).
    *   [x] Average distance found in the batch.
    *   [x] Average approximation ratio for the batch.
    *   [x] Total number of times the optimal solution was found (and percentage).
    *   [x] Calculated probability of finding the optimal in 10 runs (based on batch success rate).
    *   [x] Average time per run in the batch.
    *   [x] Total execution time for the entire batch.
*   [x] **Solution Distribution Histogram:**
    *   [x] Bar chart showing the frequency of different path lengths found across all runs in a batch.
    *   [x] Uses Recharts for rendering.
