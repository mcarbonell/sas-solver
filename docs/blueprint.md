# **App Name**: SAS Solver Suite

## Core Features:

- Algorithm Documentation: Interactive documentation of the Systematic Alternatives Search (SAS) meta-algorithm, covering its core concepts, parameters, and usage for solving NP-hard problems.
- TSP Solver: A visual interface to run the SAS algorithm in a web worker on provided TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) instances (TSPLIB), displaying the solution path and computation time.
- Problem Extension: Capability to extend the application to handle other NP-hard problems like the Knapsack problem.
- Automated Testing: A benchmarking module to run the SAS algorithm on a suite of test problems, collecting statistics like computation time, solution quality, and approximation ratio.
- Data Visualization: Data visualization tools for displaying and analyzing the performance of the SAS algorithm, including charts and graphs illustrating the distribution of solution times, approximation ratios, and other key metrics.
- Statistical Estimations with AI: Analyse algorithm benchmarking data with the use of generative AI to find estimations of functions of 'performance vs. configuration'. Generative AI used as a tool to guide data-driven optimization.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A moderate blue (#5DADE2) to represent problem-solving.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean, professional look.
- Accent color: Soft green (#A3E4D7) to highlight key data and results.
- Use clear, sans-serif fonts optimized for readability, especially in code snippets and data tables.
- Incorporate simple, geometric icons to represent different algorithms, data types, and visualization options.
- Maintain a clear, modular layout that separates documentation, algorithm execution, and data visualization components.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., highlighting paths, updating charts) to enhance the user's understanding of the algorithm's behavior.
